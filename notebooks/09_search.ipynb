    "\n",
    "The search service is separated in 3 various categories or types:\n",
    "\n",
    "    The location search which is composed of the following geocoded locations:\n",
    "        Cantons, Cities and communes\n",
    "        All names as printed on the national map (SwissNames)\n",
    "        The districts\n",

    "        The addresses\n",
    "        The cadastral parcels\n",
    "    The layer search wich enables the search of layers belonging to the GeoAdmin API.\n",
