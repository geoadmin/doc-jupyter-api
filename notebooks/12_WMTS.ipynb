    "    The zoom levels 27 and 28 (resolution 0.25m and 0.1m) are only available for a few layers, e.g. swissimage or cadastral web map. For the others layers it is only a client zoom (tiles are stretched).\n",
    "    You have to use the <ResourceURL> to construct the GetTile request.\n",
    "    Axis order: for historical reasons, EPSG:21781 WMTS tiles use the non-standard row/col order, while all other projections use the usual col/row order. However, most desktop GIS allow you to either use the advertized order or to override it.\n",
    "    The tiles of a given layer might be updated withtout resulting in a new <Time> dimension in the GetCapabilities dimension. In case your application is caching tiles locally, you need to invalidate your local cache for this layer. To check the latest change of any layer, use the Cache Update service.\n",
